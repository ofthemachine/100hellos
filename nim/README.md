# Nim

Nim is a statically typed, compiled systems programming language that is designed to be "efficient, expressive, and elegant".

## Fun Facts

*   **Python-like Syntax:** Nim's syntax is heavily inspired by Python, making it clean, readable, and easy to learn for programmers coming from a Python background.
*   **Compiles to C, C++, or JavaScript:** Nim is a true transpiled language. This allows it to generate highly optimized, dependency-free native executables or to be used for frontend web development.
*   **Performance:** Because it compiles to C/C++, Nim executables are extremely fast and memory-efficient, making it suitable for systems programming, game development, and other performance-critical applications.
*   **Powerful Metaprogramming:** Nim has a powerful macro system that allows developers to manipulate the abstract syntax tree (AST) directly. This enables the creation of expressive domain-specific languages (DSLs) and can eliminate boilerplate code.
*   **Self-Hosting:** The Nim compiler itself is written in Nim.
*   **Flexible Memory Management:** Nim offers multiple memory management strategies, from a deterministic garbage collector (the default) to manual memory management, giving developers fine-grained control over performance.
*   **Style Insensitive:** Identifiers in Nim are style-insensitive. `helloWorld` is the same as `hello_world`, allowing developers with different style preferences to collaborate easily.

This "Hello World" is implemented by compiling the Nim source code with the `nim` compiler and executing the resulting binary.
