# Elm

Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It is famous for its focus on simplicity, ease-of-use, and the complete elimination of runtime errors.

Elm's guiding principle is that if your code compiles, it works. This is achieved through a powerful static type system and a compiler that provides famously helpful error messages. It's often used for building web applications and is a great choice for developers who value reliability and maintainability.
