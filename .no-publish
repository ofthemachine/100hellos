# This repository publishes each of the directories as docker images
# and you don't need to do anything special to make that happen.
# But to accomplish that, we need to maintain a list of directories
# that we **do not** want to publish. This file is that list.

# A repository's name must:
#  - be unique within the account
#  - be 2-255 characters
#  - only lowercase, -, and _
#
# Consequently single character language names are not possible. To get around this,
# we suffix single character languages with an underscore.
