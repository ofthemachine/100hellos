# Gleam âœ¨

> A type-safe language for the Erlang virtual machine!

Gleam is a friendly language for building type-safe, scalable systems! âœ¨

## What makes Gleam special? ðŸŒŸ

- **Type-safe** - Catch bugs at compile time, not runtime
- **Functional** - Immutable data and functions as first-class citizens
- **Concurrent** - Built on the battle-tested Erlang/OTP platform
- **Fast compilation** - No more waiting around for builds
- **Friendly errors** - Error messages that actually help you
- **JavaScript target** - Run on the web or Node.js too!

## Hello World!

```gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  io.println("Hello World!")
}
```

## Fun Facts! ðŸŽ‰

- **Born in 2020** - One of the newest languages on the block
- **Erlang heritage** - Inherits 30+ years of fault-tolerance wisdom
- **Actor model** - Handle millions of concurrent processes effortlessly
- **Pattern matching** - Destructure data with elegant syntax
- **No null** - Say goodbye to null pointer exceptions forever!
- **Hot code swapping** - Update running systems without downtime
- **BEAM VM** - The same virtual machine that powers WhatsApp and Discord

## Why Erlang/OTP? ðŸš€

The Erlang virtual machine (BEAM) is legendary for:
- **9 nines uptime** (99.9999999% availability)
- **Fault isolation** - One crash doesn't bring down the whole system
- **Massive concurrency** - Handle millions of lightweight processes
- **Distribution** - Built for multi-node systems from day one

Gleam brings modern syntax and compile-time safety to this proven platform!

## Language Features ðŸ’Ž

- **Pipe operator** `|>` for readable data transformations
- **Result types** instead of exceptions
- **Immutable everything** - No accidental mutations
- **Generic types** with full type inference
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - Pay only for what you use
- **Comprehensive standard library** - Batteries included!

Perfect for web services, IoT systems, distributed applications, and anywhere you need reliability! ðŸŽ¯
