# WAT (WebAssembly Text Format)

WAT (WebAssembly Text Format) is the human-readable text representation of WebAssembly bytecode. While WebAssembly is typically generated by compiling high-level languages like C, C++, or Rust, WAT allows developers to write WebAssembly modules directly in a text-based S-expression format.

## Language Features

WAT provides direct access to WebAssembly's low-level capabilities:

- **Stack-based virtual machine**: Operations work on an implicit stack
- **Linear memory model**: Manages memory as a contiguous array of bytes
- **Type safety**: Strict typing prevents many runtime errors
- **Sandboxed execution**: WebAssembly runs in a secure, isolated environment
- **WASI support**: WebAssembly System Interface enables interaction with the host system

## Hello World Explanation

The WAT implementation uses WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) to interact with the host system:

```wat
(module
  ;; Import WASI functions for system interaction
  (import "wasi_snapshot_preview1" "fd_write" ...)

  ;; Define linear memory for string storage
  (memory 1)

  ;; Store "Hello World!" string at memory address 0
  (data (i32.const 0) "Hello World!")

  ;; Main function sets up I/O vector and calls fd_write
  (func $main (export "_start") ...)
)
```

## Interesting Facts

- **S-expression syntax**: WAT uses Lisp-like parenthesized expressions
- **Compilation target**: WAT compiles to binary WebAssembly (.wasm) format
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on any system with a WebAssembly runtime
- **Performance**: Near-native execution speed in modern browsers and runtimes
- **Security**: Capability-based security model with explicit imports

## Runtime

This implementation uses [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/), a standalone WebAssembly runtime that supports WASI for system interactions.
