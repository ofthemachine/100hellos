# ATS

ATS (Applied Type System) is a programming language designed to unify programming with formal specification. It combines features from functional and imperative programming paradigms and places a strong emphasis on static verification through its advanced type system, which includes dependent types and linear types. This allows for the prevention of common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows, at compile time.

A key feature of ATS is its ability to interoperate seamlessly with C. ATS code can be compiled to C code, which is then compiled by a standard C compiler like GCC. This makes it highly efficient and allows for easy integration with existing C libraries and systems.

Its focus on safety and performance makes it suitable for systems programming, including embedded and low-level development, where reliability and efficiency are critical.
