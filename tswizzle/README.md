# TSwizzle

TSwizzle is a Taylor Swift lyrics-inspired esoteric programming language created by [abhilipsasahoo03](https://github.com/abhilipsasahoo03/TSwizzle). This implementation uses the upstream TSwizzle interpreter to bring the lyrical programming paradigm to 100hellos.

## About TSwizzle

TSwizzle transforms Taylor Swift's iconic lyrics into programming syntax, creating a unique celebrity-themed esoteric language. Much like ArnoldC uses Arnold Schwarzenegger movie quotes, TSwizzle uses Taylor's song lyrics to express programming concepts.

## Language Features

### Taylor Swift Lyric Commands

| TSwizzle Syntax | Function | Era/Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `AND I'LL SHOW YOU EVERY VERSION OF "message" TONIGHT` | Print statement | From "Style" |
| `COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~>` | Single-line comments | From "Mean" |
| `IF YOU'VE GOT A condition I'M JEALOUS OF statement` | Conditional logic | From "Style" |
| `GOODBYE GOODBYE GOODBYE` | End of file marker | From multiple songs |
| `SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR` | Input statements | From album "Speak Now" |
| `INVISIBLE STRING TYING ME TO YOU` | String type conversion | From "invisible string" |
| `NUMBER ON ME` | Integer type conversion | From "Paper Rings" |
| `ARE WE IN THE CLEAR YET?` | Clear screen | From "Out Of The Woods" |

## Hello World Program

Our implementation showcases multiple TSwizzle keywords:

```tswizzle
COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~> This is a Taylor Swift themed Hello World program
COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~> Using as many TSwizzle keywords as possible!

COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~> Initialize our greeting variable
greeting = "Hello World!"

COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~> Check if we should display the greeting
should_greet = 1

COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~> Conditional logic using Taylor Swift lyrics
IF YOU'VE GOT A should_greet == 1 I'M JEALOUS OF AND I'LL SHOW YOU EVERY VERSION OF greeting TONIGHT

COUNTER ALL YOUR QUICK REMARKS ~> End of our Swift program
GOODBYE GOODBYE GOODBYE
```

## Cultural Significance

TSwizzle represents the intersection of pop culture and programming languages, similar to how:
- **ArnoldC** uses Schwarzenegger movie quotes
- **Shakespeare** uses Elizabethan English
- **LOLCODE** uses internet meme speak

This demonstrates how programming language design can be both functional and culturally expressive.

## Interactive Mode

TSwizzle supports a REPL mode where you can:
1. Enter your favorite Taylor Swift era
2. Execute commands interactively
3. Run `.tswizzle` files with the command: `I KNOW THE BRAVEST THING I EVER DID WAS RUN filename.tswizzle`
