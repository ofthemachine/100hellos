# Scaffolding README: Your Guide to a Clean Contribution

**Hello, contributor!** This directory was generated by `make new HELLO=[your-lang]`. It contains several template files to get you started. Please read this guide carefully to ensure your final contribution is clean and correct.

## What to Keep vs. What to Delete

The goal is to leave ONLY the files necessary for your language to run. Everything else **MUST** be deleted.

### Core Files (Usually Keep, But Modify)

*   `Dockerfile`: **KEEP and MODIFY.** You will edit this to install your language's compiler or runtime.
*   `README.md`: **KEEP and RENAME/REPLACE.** This file should be renamed to `README.md` and filled with fun, informative content about your chosen language.
*   `files/hello-world.[ext]`: **KEEP and MODIFY.** This is your actual "Hello World!" source code.

### Placeholder Files (Usually Delete)

*   `files/hello-world.sh`: **DELETE if unused.**
    *   **If your language is interpreted** and you are using a shebang in your `hello-world.[ext]` file, you **MUST** delete this file.
    *   Leaving this empty script will cause validation to fail silently.
*   `files/hello-world.lang`: **ALWAYS DELETE.** This is a placeholder and will cause an error if left in place.
*   `artifacts/`: **DELETE if unused.**
    *   This directory is part of a pattern for caching complex, multi-step builds.
    *   If you are simply installing a package via `apk` or `wget`, you do not need this. Delete it.
*   `README.scaffolding`: **ALWAYS DELETE.** That's this file! Once you've read it, get rid of it.
